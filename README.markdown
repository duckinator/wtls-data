# What is this?

TODO: Somebody make this README less messy. I'm just writing it quickly before I lose track of the links.

TODO: Find or create a PDF and/or website containing all of the pages. Preferably two: one that is a text transcription and one of the original images.

[_why ("why the lucky stiff")](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) came back briefly through his website, [whytheluckystiff.net](http://whytheluckystiff.net), and was putting content up in a way that appeared to operate similarly to a printer spool, and was using actual [PCL files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_Command_Language).

This contains all of the files he added, from December 12, 2012 until April 19th, 2013.

It also includes PDFs generated by @steveklabnik, PDFs generated by @tsion, and PDFs generated by @arnebrasseur.
I am not sure if any of the different versions of the PDFs differ, which is why I added duplicates of them all.

@steveklabnik has all of the PDFs combined into one as CLOSURE.pdf at https://github.com/steveklabnik/CLOSURE.
